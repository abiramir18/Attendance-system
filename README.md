The Automated Attendance System is designed to mark student attendance automatically using face recognition technology. This system eliminates the need for manual attendance marking, making the process faster, accurate, and reliable.

It uses OpenCV for image processing, Haar Cascade/MTCNN for face detection, and FaceNet/LBPH for face recognition. The system captures images from a live camera feed, detects and recognizes faces, and then records the attendance in a database.
